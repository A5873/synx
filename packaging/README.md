### RPM (Red Hat/Fedora)
- Location: `rpm/`
- Status: ðŸ”„ Ready for testing

- Platform-specific build tools:
  - Debian: `build-essential`, `debhelper`, `dh-make`
  - RPM: `rpm-build`, `rpmdevtools`
  - AUR: `base-devel`

### General Build Process
1. Build the Rust binary: `cargo build --release`
2. Package using the appropriate tool for your target format
3. Test the package in a clean environment
4. Submit for distribution

See individual package directories for specific build instructions.

## Package Maintenance

### Version Updates
When updating Synx version:
1. Update version in `source/Cargo.toml`
2. Update the following files:
   - `aur/PKGBUILD`
   - `rpm/synx.spec`
   - `deb/debian/changelog`
   - `brew/synx.rb`

### Distribution Status
- âœ… AUR: Active and maintained
- ðŸ”„ Debian: In progress
- ðŸ”„ RPM: Ready for testing
- ðŸ”„ Homebrew: Under review

## Contributing
To add support for a new package format:
1. Create a new directory for the package format
2. Add necessary build configurations
3. Document build and installation process
4. Test thoroughly before submitting

For detailed contribution guidelines, see the main repository README.

## Package Distribution Strategy

### Binary and Package Files
Large binary and package files are stored in specific locations:

- Debian packages and source tarballs: `deb/pool/main/s/synx/`
- RPM packages: `rpm/RPMS/`
- Homebrew bottles: Managed by Homebrew tap
- AUR: Built locally by users

These files are included in the git repository for version tracking but should be distributed through their respective package repositories:

- Debian/Ubuntu: Through the APT repository
- RPM: Through the YUM/DNF repository
- Homebrew: Through the Homebrew bottle system
- AUR: Built from source by package manager

### File Locations
- Source tarballs (*.tar.gz): Required for package builds
- Binary packages (*.deb, *.rpm): Generated during package builds
- Build artifacts: Generated during package creation, stored in respective build directories

Note: While these files are tracked in git for version control, future versions may move to a separate release management system as the project grows.
