# Synx Logo Design Concept

## Design Brief

A modern, minimalist logo for Synx, a universal syntax validator and linter dispatcher built with Rust.

## Logo Concept

### Primary Elements

1. **Main Symbol**: A stylized "S" formed by two interlocking brackets `{ }` that create an S-like shape. This represents both:
   - The first letter of "Synx"
   - Code syntax elements (brackets/braces)

2. **Checkmark Integration**: A subtle green checkmark element integrated into the design, suggesting validation and correctness.

3. **Color Scheme**:
   - Primary: Deep navy blue (#1A3A5F) - representing reliability and professionalism
   - Secondary: Bright teal (#00B2A9) - representing the modern, tech-forward nature
   - Accent: Emerald green (#00BF6F) - for the checkmark, representing validation success

### Typography

The wordmark "SYNX" in a clean, modern sans-serif typeface (like Roboto or Inter) with slightly increased letter spacing for clarity. The font weight should be medium or semi-bold for good visibility at smaller sizes.

### Variants

1. **Full Logo**: Symbol + wordmark side by side
2. **Square Avatar**: Just the symbol for use in small spaces (GitHub avatar, favicon)
3. **Dark Mode Version**: Inverted colors for dark backgrounds

### Design Elements

- **Clean Lines**: Use precise geometric forms with clean edges
- **Balanced Whitespace**: Ensure the logo has breathing room
- **Scalability**: Design should look good from favicon size to large header displays

### Metaphors Conveyed

- **Code Validation**: The checkmark element represents successful validation
- **Multi-language Support**: The interlocking nature of the brackets suggests flexibility and adaptability
- **Simplicity**: Clean design reflects the tool's straightforward, efficient approach

### Use Cases

This logo will be used for:
- GitHub repository 
- Package distribution
- Website/documentation
- CLI startup banner
- Marketing materials

### Style Inspirations

- GitHub's Octicon design system
- Rust programming language logo (clean, minimal)
- VS Code logo (modern tech aesthetic)
