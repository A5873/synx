# feat: Implement comprehensive Interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI)

## Overview

This commit introduces a full-featured Terminal User Interface (TUI) for interactive code issue review and fixing, similar to `git add -p` for interactive staging. The TUI provides an intuitive way to review, understand, and fix code issues with rich visual feedback and comprehensive keyboard navigation.

## Key Features Implemented

### Core TUI Infrastructure
- **Main TUI Application** (`src/tui/mod.rs`): Complete event loop, state management, and UI rendering
- **Syntax Integration** (`src/tui/syntax.rs`): Tree-sitter parsers and syntect syntax highlighting
- **Issue State Management** (`src/tui/issue_state.rs`): Comprehensive issue tracking and action management
- **Custom Widgets** (`src/tui/widgets.rs`): Specialized UI components for different content types

### Four-Tab Interface
1. **Issues Tab**: Syntax-highlighted code with issue highlighting and detailed issue information
2. **Syntax Tree Tab**: Abstract Syntax Tree visualization for understanding code structure
3. **Actions Tab**: Interactive fixing options with multiple fix strategies
4. **Explanation Tab**: Detailed rule explanations with code examples

### Rich User Experience
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Multi-language support (Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C/C++, Go, Java)
- **Interactive Navigation**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow
- **Issue Management**: Fix, ignore, or defer issues with full state tracking
- **Session Results**: Summary of fixed, ignored, and remaining issues

### Technical Architecture
- **Static Rendering Pattern**: Avoids Rust borrowing issues with tui-rs closures
- **Multi-language Parser Support**: Tree-sitter integration for 8+ languages
- **Memory Efficient**: Cloning strategy for safe concurrent rendering
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and terminal cleanup

## Usage

```bash
# Launch interactive mode directly
synx validate --interactive src/

# Or use with existing validation report
synx interactive --report validation_report.json
```

## Keyboard Navigation

### Global Commands
- `q` - Quit the TUI
- `Tab` - Switch between tabs
- `↑/↓` - Scroll up/down
- `Page Up/Down` - Scroll by page

### Issue Management
- `n`/`p` - Navigate issues
- `f` - Fix current issue
- `i` - Ignore current issue
- `e` - Show explanation

### Context-Sensitive Commands
- **Actions Tab**: `1`/`2`/`3` for specific fixes, `a` for automatic fix
- **Explanation Tab**: `x` to toggle examples, `t` for related rules

## Documentation

### User Documentation
- **`docs/TUI_GUIDE.md`**: Comprehensive user guide with examples and workflows
- **`docs/TUI_ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Technical architecture and implementation details

### Features Covered
- Complete interface overview and navigation
- Keyboard reference and shortcuts
- Troubleshooting and best practices
- Technical architecture and extension points

### Updated Files
- `README.md` (main): Added TUI section and updated features
- `source/README.md`: Updated development status and metrics
- `Cargo.toml`: Added TUI dependencies (tui, crossterm, syntect, tree-sitter-*)

## Dependencies Added

### Core TUI Dependencies
- `tui = "0.19"` - Terminal UI framework
- `crossterm = "0.27"` - Cross-platform terminal handling
- `syntect = "5.0"` - Syntax highlighting
- `uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4"] }` - Issue ID generation

### Tree-sitter Language Support
- `tree-sitter = "0.20"`
- `tree-sitter-rust = "0.20"`
- `tree-sitter-python = "0.20"`
- `tree-sitter-javascript = "0.20"`
- `tree-sitter-typescript = "0.20"`
- `tree-sitter-c = "0.20"`
- `tree-sitter-cpp = "0.20"`
- `tree-sitter-go = "0.20"`
- `tree-sitter-java = "0.20"`

## Code Quality

### Metrics
- **~2,250 lines of new Rust code** across TUI modules
- **500+ lines of documentation**
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Memory-safe architecture** with proper borrowing patterns

### Testing Status
- **Builds successfully** with only expected unused code warnings
- **No compilation errors** or safety issues
- **Ready for integration testing** and user feedback

## Impact

### User Experience
- **Interactive workflow** similar to Git's interactive staging
- **Educational value** with rule explanations and examples
- **Efficiency gains** through keyboard-driven navigation
- **Better issue understanding** with syntax tree visualization

### Development
- **Foundation for advanced features** (LSP integration, web UI)
- **Extensible architecture** for adding new widgets and functionality
- **Performance optimized** rendering with static methods

This implementation represents a significant enhancement to Synx's usability and positions it as a comprehensive code quality tool with both CLI and interactive capabilities.
