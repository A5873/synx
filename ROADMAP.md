This document outlines the development plan and future direction for the Synx project.

## Current Status (v0.2.1)

Synx is currently in active development with a focus on expanding language support and improving the installation experience.

**Recently Completed:**
- âœ… Enhanced installation script with improved feedback and progress indicators
- âœ… Added ASCII banner to tool output
- âœ… Restructured validation logic for better error handling
- âœ… Added GitHub Actions workflow for CI
- âœ… Created test files for multiple languages (Go, Java, TypeScript)
- âœ… Implemented validators for several languages (Java, Go, TypeScript, etc.)

**In Progress:**
- ðŸ”„ Implementing C, C#, Python, and JavaScript validators
- ðŸ”„ Enhancing test coverage for all validators
- ðŸ”„ Improving configuration system for validator settings

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current - Q3 2025)

This phase focuses on establishing the foundation of Synx as a reliable syntax validator.

**Milestones:**
1. **Language Support Expansion** - Q2 2025
   - Complete implementation of all base validators (C, C#, Python, JavaScript)
   - Add comprehensive test coverage for each validator
   - Create example files for all supported languages

2. **Enhanced Installation & Documentation** - Q3 2025
   - Streamline installation across all supported platforms
   - Create comprehensive documentation for each validator
   - Improve error messages and troubleshooting guides

3. **Configuration System** - Q3 2025
   - Implement project-wide configuration file support
   - Add per-language configuration options
   - Create configuration templates for common use cases

**Timeline:** Complete by September 2025

### Phase 2: Enhanced Validation (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)

This phase focuses on improving the validation experience and adding more advanced features.

**Milestones:**

3. **Improved Feedback System** - Q1 2026
   - Add visual output for validation results
   - Generate HTML reports of validation issues
   - Create machine-readable output formats (JSON, XML)

4. **IDE Integration** - Q1 2026
   - Create VS Code extension
   - Develop JetBrains IDE plugin
   - Add Language Server Protocol (LSP) support

**Timeline:** Complete by March 2026

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Q2 2026 - Q4 2026)

This phase introduces features that transform Synx from a validator to a comprehensive code quality tool.

**Milestones:**
1. **Automated Fixes** - Q2 2026

   - API for remote validation
   - Subscription-based advanced features

**Timeline:** Initial enterprise features by Q4 2027

## Future Considerations

Areas we're considering for future development:

1. **AI-assisted validation**
   - Use ML to predict potential issues
   - Smart suggestions for complex code patterns
   - Learning from historical validation patterns

2. **Cross-project analysis**
   - Dependency validation
   - Consistency checking across repositories
   - Organization-wide style enforcement

3. **Education platform**
   - Interactive tutorials on code quality
   - Gamification of code improvement
   - Learning pathways for different languages

4. **Ecosystem expansion**
   - Language-specific plugin system
   - Integration with code review platforms
   - Support for specialized frameworks
