This document outlines the development plan and future direction for the Synx project.

## Current Status (v0.3.0)

Synx has reached a major milestone with the completion of its comprehensive plugin system and advanced enterprise features. The project has significantly exceeded initial expectations.

**Recently Completed (v0.3.0 Major Release):**
- âœ… **Complete Plugin Architecture**: Registry, loader, lifecycle management, and security integration
- âœ… **Built-in Plugin Suite**: Python validator, JSON formatter, Basic analyzer with full CLI integration
- âœ… **Advanced CLI System**: 8+ command categories (scan, config, cache, intelligence, daemon, performance, monitor, plugin)
- âœ… **Daemon Mode**: Always-on background service with system integration
- âœ… **Intelligence Engine**: Code analysis, metrics, patterns, and learning capabilities
- âœ… **Performance System**: Real-time monitoring, optimization, and benchmarking
- âœ… **Enterprise Security**: Comprehensive audit logging, resource limits, and policy enforcement
- âœ… **Enhanced ASCII Banner**: Professional terminal presentation with perfect alignment
- âœ… **Interactive TUI**: Real-time monitoring interface

**Current Focus Areas:**
- ðŸ”„ Dynamic plugin loading (WASM and shared library support)
